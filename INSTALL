On UNIX-like systems you can install using make:

make && make install

If you want to disable POSIX RE or pcre support from grep you can use:

make CPPFLAGS='-DWITHOUT_POSIX'
or
make CPPFLAGS='-DWITHOUT_PCRE'

or both if you'd like (although it would result in quite a limited csvgrep).


On non-UNIX or systems without make, build libcsv (provided as a seperate
package, see the README) as a shared library or object file, and build 
version.c and helper.c in the src directory as object files.  Build each
of the programs in the src directory with the version and helper object
files and libcsv, see your compiler for details on how to do this, with
gcc this can be done like so:

gcc -c version.c -o version.o
gcc -c helper.c -o helper.o
gcc -c libcsv.c -o libcsv.o

gcc csvcount.c version.o helper.o libcsv.o -o csvcount

or if you are building against the libcsv library dynamically:
gcc csvcount.c version.o helper.o -lcsv -o csvcount

If you are building csvgrep with pcre support you will need the PCRE library as
well, see the README for details.
