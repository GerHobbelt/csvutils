.SH DESCRIPTION
.ft
.ft
.fi
Read CSV data from standard input or \fIFILE\fR and break the data into multiple files based on the value
of the provided \fIFIELD\fR.
As each record is read it will be printed to a file whose name is composed of an optional prefix, the value
of the specified field for that record, and an optional suffix, .csv by default.  If the value of the break
field contains a null character it will be truncated in the filename, any other characters in the break
field will be used in the filename including characters that may be used as a directory seperator on your
operating system, keep this in mind.  Systems that disallow certain characters in a filename may cause
csvbreak to fail if these characters are present in the break field.
.TP
\fB-c\fR, \fB--print-counts\fR
don't create break files, just display the distinct values of the break field
and the number of occurences in the file of each value
.TP
\fB-d\fR, \fB--delimiter\fR=\fIDELIM\fR

field name or number to break on.  fields may be specified by number starting at 1 or by field name.

list, if any field names cannot be resolved from the first record an error will occur.
